## Saraf's Weekly planner

## Description

* This weekly schedule has been programmed to help employees with a busy schedule keep up with important events so that they can manage their time efficiently 

## User Interface 

When the user inputs an event by typing it into the text space, they are able to save it to the browser to view later.

   The images above correspond to the "past.png", "present.png" & "future.png" files in the assets folder. They are examples of what the past, present & future time slots look like. There is a clock icon next to the time, a textarea for the userinput & a save button to save the content into local storage to view later. 

## Git repo link 

There are two repositories for this application; https://github.com/Sophack/sarafsPlanner & https://github.com/Sophack/planner

The first repo is the one I originally started with, it has all the commit history. There were issues with deployment that I was not able to resolve so I made a new repo & it was successful. The file path was too complex and once I took the CSS and Javascript files out of the sub folder the deployment went through. 

succesful repo link: https://github.com/Sophack/planner

## Deployed application link

The deployed application is under another repo as I was not able to get deployment to work under this one.
